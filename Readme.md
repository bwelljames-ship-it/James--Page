-Brief Description, This is a page about me that tells you about me 

-peer review Jesus Salgado - Nice choice in background image and centering your content, overall your page is very plain(not a bad thing) and minimal which could be a good thing if that's just your personality. Good use of the navbar to keep it minimal as well which shows that you don't like to overcrowd the page but it might be good to have all of your pages accessable or at least on the navbar so that the user knows they can click on them while they are browsing.
